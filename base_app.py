For example, when to wake up, what to wear, who to call, which route to take when traveling, how to sit, the list goes on and on. While several of these are repetitive and we do not usually take notice (and allow it to be done subconsciously), there are many others that are new and require conscious thought.  And we learn along the way. Businesses, similarly, apply their past learning to decision-making related to operations and new initiatives e.g. relating to customer classification, products, etc. However, it gets a little more complex here as there are multiple stakeholders involved. Additionally, the decisions need to be accurate owing to their wider impact. With the evolution in digital technology, humans have developed multiple assets; machines being one of them. We have learned (and continue) to use machines for analyzing data using statistics to generate useful insights that serve as an aid in making decisions and forecasts.")
